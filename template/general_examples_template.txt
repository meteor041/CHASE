# Task
Generate **{num_examples}** distinct pairs of natural-language questions and SQL queries for the database described below.

# Database schema  
{db_schema}

# Coverage requirements
The full set of examples should collectively satisfy all seven feature types:

1. simple **SELECT**
2. **WHERE** clause
3. multi-table **JOIN**
4. **GROUP BY** + aggregate
5. **ORDER BY**
6. **LIMIT**
7. a **subquery**

A single example may cover ≥1 feature; ensure every feature appears at least once.

# Output format  (critical)
Return exactly **{num_examples}** blocks; each block:

```
Question: <natural-language question>
SQL: <valid SQL ending with a semicolon>
```

Formatting rules:
- Use real table/column names from the schema.
- End each SQL with one semicolon.
- No markdown fences, no extra commentary, no numbering, no blank lines inside a block.
- Separate blocks with a single blank line.

# Validation checklist (before you answer)
- [ ] Each SQL parses against the schema.
- [ ] No duplicate questions or identical SQL.
- [ ] All seven feature types are covered at least once.
