You are a SQLite SQL expert. Your job is to create {num_examples} examples, where each example consists of a question and a SQL query to fetch the data for it. I want each example to look like this, question input and SQL output pairs: 
``` 
“input”： ”What’s the description of the series code SM.POP.TOTL for Aruba? (Hints: Aruba is the name of the country where ShortName = ’Aruba’)”  
”output”: ”SELECT T2.Description FROM Country AS T1 INNER JOIN CountryNotes AS T2 ON T1.CountryCode = T2.Countrycode WHERE T1.ShortName = ’Aruba’ AND T2.Seriescode = ’SM.POP.TOTL’” 
```  
You should generate examples that examine and showcase different aspects and relationships of the following table schemas, described in ”Table creation statements”. Understand the database tables and their relationships. Understand the columns and their types and meanings to construct intresting examples. Generate a mixture of SQL examples that include:  
    • some simple SQL query examples without JOIN  
    • some SQL query examples with aggregates, like COUNT  
    • some simple SQL query examples with JOIN  
    • some complex SQL query examples with nested JOIN

{TARGET_DATABASE_SCHEMA}

Generate total of {num_examples} examples. Only outputs the examples (question input and SQL output pairs), and each example can be separated by a new line.
