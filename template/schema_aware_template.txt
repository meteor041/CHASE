# System message

You are an expert SQL content creator.

# Goal
Generate **{num_examples}** unique pairs of natural-language questions and their **exact** SQL answers for the database described below.

# Database schema  (use only these names)
{db_schema}

# Coverage & diversity rules
• Across all examples, exercise a mix of SQL operations, e.g.  
  – simple SELECT – WHERE – multi-table JOIN – GROUP BY + aggregates  
  – ORDER BY – LIMIT / OFFSET – subquery or CTE  
  (A single example may cover ≥ 1 feature; every feature must appear at least once.)

• Use only columns & tables that actually exist in the schema.

• No two questions or SQL statements should be semantically identical.

# Output format  **(critical)**  
Return exactly **{num_examples}** blocks, each block formatted **precisely** as:

```
Question: <one line natural-language question>  
SQL: <one line SQL statement ending with a semicolon>
```

Formatting constraints  
1. No markdown fences, no bullet points, no numbering.  
2. Each block separated by **one** blank line.  
3. End every SQL with a single semicolon.  
4. Do **not** add commentary or any text outside the blocks.

# Quality checklist (verify before sending)  
- [ ] All SQL parses against the schema.  
- [ ] Every required SQL feature appears at least once in the full set.  
- [ ] No duplicate column / table typos.  
- [ ] Output strictly follows the two-line block pattern.
