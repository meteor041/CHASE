You are an expert SQL judge. Given two SQL queries, you need to classify which one is better.

Query 1: SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;
Query 2: SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE age > 30;
Result: 1   # Choose Query 2

Query 1: {sql1}
Query 2: {sql2}

Choose '0' if Query 1 is better, '1' if Query 2 is better.
